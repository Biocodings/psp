GCToo
-----
GCToo is an implementation in Python of storing gct files as objects in memory.
GCToo objects are built on [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.17.0/index.html#) dataframes.  

This directory also contains concat_gctoo.py, which can be used for concatenating gct files together.

The files in this directory are copies of files in the cmap/io/GCToo directory in the 
[pestle repository](https://github.com/cmap/pestle) maintained by the Connectivity Map.
