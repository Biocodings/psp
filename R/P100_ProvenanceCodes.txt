Code	Description
L2X	log2-transform
RMN	row median normaliztion
SF#	sample filter for poor coverage where the final number is the decile needed to pass (i.e. SF8 = 80% probes present = passing)
PF#	probes filter for poor observation rate where the final number is the decile needed to pass (i.e. PF8 = 80% probe observation rate = passing)
LLB	linear-optimization load balancing, based on minimizing distance to median sample
OSF	outlier sample filtering, if sample is far away from median even after load balancing operations (3 sd away from mean distance)
EFF	Enrichment factor filtering (weed out poorly enriched samples)
ISR	Index sample recentering - subtract index sample from all other samples (should be all 0's in this column)
EFC	Enrichment factor correction - correct each sample by it's median enrichment factor across 8 or 9 QC medium probes
